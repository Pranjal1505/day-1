# Identifying Potential Security Risks from Open Ports


1. Port 53 – DNS (Domain Name System)
This port is used to convert domain names into IP addresses. 
If it’s open to the internet, attackers might misuse it for DNS amplification attacks. 
Solution : it's safer to allow only internal devices to use this service and block external access unless it’s really needed.


2. Port 80 – HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
This is used for web traffic, but the problem is it doesn’t encrypt data. That means someone can easily intercept and read the information. 
Solution: It’s better to use HTTPS (secure version) instead, and close port 80 if it’s not required.


3. Port 135 – Microsoft RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
Windows uses this port for communication between its services. However, attackers can try to use it for remote attacks or gathering information. 
Solution: It should be blocked on public networks and only allowed internally if needed.


4. Port 139 – NetBIOS
This is usually used for sharing files over a local network. But it can be risky because attackers might be able to see shared folders or even usernames.
Solution: When file sharing is not in use we should keep it turn off.

5. Port 445 – SMB (Server Message Block)
Another port related to file sharing in Windows. It's known to be vulnerable and was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack. 
Solution: To stay safe, we should keep it blocked unless we are using it in a secure, private network.


6. Port 902 – VMware Server Console Port
This port is used by VMware to manage virtual machines. If someone gets access to it, they might be able to control the VMs. 
Solution: It should only be accessible within trusted IP ranges and not exposed publicly.


7. Port 912 – VMware Remote Console (Apex)
Similar to port 902, this one is also used by VMware for remote access. It could be dangerous if it's left open to everyone. 
Solution: It should only be accessible within trusted IP ranges and not exposed publicly and limiting its use to internal systems only.


8. Port 2869 – ICSLAP (used by UPnP – Universal Plug and Play)
UPnP is meant to help devices find each other automatically, but it can also open ports without asking the user. 
That can be risky because it might expose services to the internet. 
Solution : It's best to disable UPnP unless it's really needed.
